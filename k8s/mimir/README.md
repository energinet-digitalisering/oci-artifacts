# Mimir

Mimir is an open source, horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant TSDB for long-term storage for Prometheus metrics.

These manifests wrap the mimir-distributed Helm chart. The configuration provided by these manifests spin up a minimal set of Mimir services, and is only meant for testing it and trying it out - not for production.
